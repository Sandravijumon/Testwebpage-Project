                <h3>About Green Tea</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Common Names:</strong> green tea<br>
                    <strong>Latin Names:</strong> Camellia sinensis
                </p>
                <p>
                    Green, black, and oolong teas all come from the same plant, Camellia sinensis, but are prepared
                    using different methods. To produce green tea, leaves from the plant are steamed, pan fried, and
                    dried. Tea has been used for medicinal purposes in China and Japan for thousands of years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Green tea as a beverage or dietary supplement is promoted for improving mental alertness, relieving
                    digestive symptoms and headaches, and promoting weight loss. Green tea and its components, including
                    epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), have been studied for their possible protective effects against
                    heart disease and cancer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a topical ointment, sinecatechins (brand
                    name Veregen), which includes extracted components of green tea leaves and is used for the treatment
                    of genital warts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>How Much Do We Know?</strong><br>
                    Although many studies have been done on green tea and its extracts, definite conclusions cannot yet
                    be reached on whether green tea is helpful for most of the purposes for which it is used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What Have We Learned?</strong><br>
                    Green tea contains caffeine. Drinking caffeinated beverages throughout the day seems to prevent a
                    decline in alertness. One study looked at the effect of taking only a main component of green
                    tea—EGCG—on mental capabilities. In that study, mental capabilities in adults didn’t improve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The FDA has approved a specific green tea extract ointment as a prescription drug for treating
                    genital warts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Studies of green tea and cancer in people have had inconsistent results. The National Cancer
                    Institute does not recommend for or against using green tea to reduce the risk of any type of
                    cancer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A small number of studies suggests that both green and black tea might have beneficial effects on
                    some heart disease risk factors, including blood pressure and cholesterol. The research has
                    limitations though, including how the data was evaluated and differences in study populations, so no
                    definite conclusions have been reached.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Green tea extracts haven’t been shown to produce a meaningful weight loss in adults who are
                    overweight or obese. They also haven’t been shown to help people maintain a weight loss.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s uncertain whether green tea is helpful for other conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) is funding research on green
                    tea and its extracts, including studies on new forms of green tea extracts for preventing symptoms
                    of inflammatory bowel disease and for lowering cholesterol.
